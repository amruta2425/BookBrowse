# BookBrowse
### ðŸ‘‰ [Go to BookBrowse](https://bookbrowse.netlify.app/)


# Overview
To create a web application that fetches data from the Google Books API and displays them on the screen. Further information about the books (image, description, preview link) should be displayed. 


# MVP
- Create a page that allows users to search for books Page should include the following:

- Header section introducing the page

- Form containing a text input and a submit / search button

- A grid of books

# Instructions:

- When the submit button is clicked you need the request books from the Google books API using the input value as your query string
- The books that you receive should be rendered in the books grid.
- Each book in the grid should have an image, author, title and description
- The grid should be responsive on different screen sizes
- You should use async / await for your request code, NOT .then (.then in react components is fine)

# Styling (required):

- This application should look good, take some time to pick a palette and plan out your design. You can use tools like Figma or wireframe pro to plan what your application is going to look like.

- You must use SCSS Modules for component styling
- Your palette should use variables
- Application Design (reccomendations ):

- Functions should do 1 thing, and should be as pure and reusable as possible
- Consider using functions to clean your data, rather than conditional rendering in your components
- Use a container component for loading data
- React components should be as dumb as possible (rely on props)
- Always use iterators over loops
- Always parametrize and abstract large pieces of duplicate code.

# Tech Stack

- React
- SCSS# book-browse

# Build Steps
Run the Frontend React application, by executing the following commands from the root folder of this project:

```
cd book-browse
npm install
npm run dev
```

# Design Goals
For the design, I kept it simple with minimal styles yet clearly displayed all the data. I had a dark background and Cards displayed in white as the contrast will give the User more focus on the Data. On Furthur clicking on the book, a modal should up to display more details of the book.

# Approach
* Fetch the books using the URL and print it in the console.
* Using react useState, store all the books.
* Display and style the books in UI.
* Design a modal to view more about the books.
* Update the Readme.

# Features
* Single page react application with a Search Bar and Books Cards to display the results. The app is designed to display related books based on the input given in the Search Bar.

* The Landing page of the application consists of a Search Bar which takes input to fetch and displays a list of books related to Search Term from the following REST API: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q={Search Term} by default. By Default, the app displays 20 books to the User. If an error occurs while fetching data, the user will see a message indicating that "Couldn't find any books", rather than the application appearing to do nothing. The app displays "Loading" state while fetching the data.

* The data is presented in a Card which includes the book Image, title, authors. If the data is missing the app shows relevant information rather than displaying empty fields. For example the author or published date may be missing. App handles the missing data by displaying "UnKnown Author" or "No Title" to let the user know that the information is not available. A default image source is used for books with missing image links.

* By clicking on the Book Card of the book users can view more details. By clicking on it opens a modal which displays the details of the selected book. Image, title, author and description and preview button of the books are displayed in the modal. If the book's title or author(s) are missing, "UnKnown Author" is rendered. A back button is provided to go back to main page, closes the modal and can view all the books.

* If the user wants to read the book, by clicking on the preview button the page loads the book in different window to ensure the users can open as many books as they want.


# Challenges

* Understanding React and diving the components is bit of a challenge because this was the first project I have ever done in React.
